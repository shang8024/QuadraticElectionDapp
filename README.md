## Notes 

## FAQ
- **How to access different user priviledges?**
   For admin roles, signup then login with username and password both to 'admin' (NOTE: case sensitive, all lowercase). It will take you to list of all users where you can whitelist them and mint nfts for them.

   For normal user/voter, sign up and login with any username or password, where you can request to get whitelisted and access nfts for anonymous voting. 

   When a user requests the services mentioned above, the list on the admin page is updated in real time (you might to refresh the page). 

- **How do I use this with Ganache (or any other network)?**

  The Truffle project is set to deploy to Ganache by default. If you'd like to change this, it's as easy as modifying the Truffle config file! Check out [our documentation on adding network configurations](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/#networks). From there, you can run `truffle migrate` pointed to another network, restart the React dev server, and see the change take place.

- **Where can I find more resources?**

  This Box is a sweet combo of [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org). Either one would be a great place to start!
